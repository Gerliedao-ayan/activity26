## Activity 26: CSS FLEX

CSS Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout module that offers a powerful and flexible way to arrange and align items within a container. It provides a simple and efficient method for creating responsive and dynamic layouts that adapt well to different screen sizes.

Think of Flexbox as a powerful tool for organizing items in a row or column. It allows you to easily control the spacing, alignment, and distribution of these items within their container. It's like having a set of tools to arrange furniture in a room â€“ you can move things around, resize them, and make sure everything looks balanced and organized.

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:

* **Flex Container:** The parent element that holds the flex items. You apply Flexbox properties to this container to control the layout of its children.
* **Flex Items:** The child elements within the flex container. They are the individual items that you want to arrange.

Flexbox offers a wide range of properties to control the layout, including:

* **Direction:**  You can arrange items in a row (horizontal) or a column (vertical).
* **Alignment:**  You can align items to the start, end, center, or space them evenly within the container.
* **Spacing:**  You can control the spacing between flex items.
* **Order:**  You can change the order of flex items within the container.

Flexbox is particularly useful for creating responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, making it a valuable tool for modern web development.
